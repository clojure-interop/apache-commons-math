(ns org.apache.commons.math4.stat.correlation.StorelessCovariance
  "Covariance implementation that does not require input data to be
  stored in memory. The size of the covariance matrix is specified in the
  constructor. Specific elements of the matrix are incrementally updated with
  calls to incrementRow() or increment Covariance().

  This class is based on a paper written by Philippe PÃ©bay:

  Formulas for Robust, One-Pass Parallel Computation of Covariances and
  Arbitrary-Order Statistical Moments, 2008, Technical Report SAND2008-6212,
  Sandia National Laboratories.

  Note: the underlying covariance matrix is symmetric, thus only the
  upper triangular part of the matrix is stored and updated each increment."
