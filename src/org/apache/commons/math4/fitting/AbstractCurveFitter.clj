(ns org.apache.commons.math4.fitting.AbstractCurveFitter
  "Base class that contains common code for fitting parametric univariate
  real functions y = f(pi;x), where x is
  the independent variable and the pi are the
  parameters.

  A fitter will find the optimal values of the parameters by
  fitting the curve so it remains very close to a set of
  N observed points (xk, yk),
  0 <= k < N.

  An algorithm usually performs the fit by finding the parameter
  values that minimizes the objective function


   âˆ‘yk - f(xk)2,
  which is actually a least-squares problem.
  This class contains boilerplate code for calling the
  fit(Collection) method for obtaining the parameters.
  The problem setup, such as the choice of optimization algorithm
  for fitting a specific function is delegated to subclasses."
