(ns org.apache.commons.math4.linear.CholeskyDecomposition
  "Calculates the Cholesky decomposition of a matrix.
  The Cholesky decomposition of a real symmetric positive-definite
  matrix A consists of a lower triangular matrix L with same size such
  that: A = LLT. In a sense, this is the square root of A.
  This class is based on the class with similar name from the
  JAMA library, with the
  following changes:

    a getLT method has been added,
    the isspd method has been removed, since the constructor of
    this class throws a NonPositiveDefiniteMatrixException when a
    matrix cannot be decomposed,
    a getDeterminant method has been added,
    the solve method has been replaced by a getSolver method and the equivalent method provided by the returned
    DecompositionSolver."
