  "Faster, more accurate, portable alternative to Math and
  StrictMath for large scale computation.

  FastMath is a drop-in replacement for both Math and StrictMath. This
  means that for any method in Math (say Math.sin(x) or
  Math.cbrt(y)), user can directly change the class and use the
  methods as is (using FastMath.sin(x) or FastMath.cbrt(y)
  in the previous example).


  FastMath speed is achieved by relying heavily on optimizing compilers
  to native code present in many JVMs today and use of large tables.
  The larger tables are lazily initialized on first use, so that the setup
  time does not penalize methods that don't need them.


  Note that FastMath is
  extensively used inside Apache Commons Math, so by calling some algorithms,
  the overhead when the the tables need to be initialized will occur
  regardless of the end-user calling FastMath methods directly or not.
  Performance figures for a specific JVM and hardware can be evaluated by
  running the FastMathTestPerformance tests in the test directory of the source
  distribution.


  FastMath accuracy should be mostly independent of the JVM as it relies only
  on IEEE-754 basic operations and on embedded tables. Almost all operations
  are accurate to about 0.5 ulp throughout the domain range. This statement,
  of course is only a rough global observed behavior, it is not a
  guarantee for every double numbers input (see William Kahan's Table
  Maker's Dilemma).


  FastMath additionally implements the following methods not found in Math/StrictMath:

  asinh(double)
  acosh(double)
  atanh(double)

  The following methods are found in Math/StrictMath since 1.6 only, they are provided
  by FastMath even in 1.5 Java virtual machines

  getExponent(double)
  nextAfter(double,double)
  nextUp(double)
